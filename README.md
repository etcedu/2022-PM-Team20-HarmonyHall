# Harmony-Hall
Harmony Hall is an interactive 3D experience that was designed to help therapists and neurodivergent patients recognize and learn about emotion.

It was created as a collaboration between @nrpatel04 (lead developer, asset design), @DebApple (audio design and music-therapy research), @AdrianH2003 (co-developer), and @vanessah04 (asset and art design) as a part of Simcoach Games 2022 Summer Apprenticeship. https://www.simcoachgames.com/apprenticeship

Hamony Hall is an interactive game made in Unity. It is an interactive experience based on music therapy and emotional connection. It's designed to be a tool for therapists to use to help neurodivergent people learn more about how to recognize and articulate emotions. In Harmony Hall, you take the role of a museum curator whose job is to assign an emotion to each section of the museum, which contain various themes and audiovisual assets.

This educational therapeutic game is intended to be a tool to guide the exploration of emotions through music and visual art. It is inspired by a practice among music therapists to use music as an educational tool to help young children, people with autism, and people with other forms of disorders with experiencing and understanding emotions. The player is expected to explore the entire museum and give each hall its corresponding name (named after emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, etc). 

Project was programmed in C#, and assets were imported from the asset store or created in Blender/Maya.
